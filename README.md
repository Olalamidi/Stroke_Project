Stroke incidence peaks in individuals aged 65 and older due to aging, smoking history, and high glucose levels, with former smokers remaining at risk. Younger adults face emerging concerns linked to glucose and BMI. Targeted interventions, like lifestyle changes and smoking cessation, can reduce stroke rates by 12%, especially in 45 and older.
